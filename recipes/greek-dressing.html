    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy to make salad dressing that is better than store bought. The ingredients are simple things that 
        are almost always on hand and no special equipment is required. We love putting this dressing on everything from salad to 
        potatoes! This dressing stores well for a few days in the fridge, just remember to set it out at room temperature about
        an hour before using so it has time to soften.
